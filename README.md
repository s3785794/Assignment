				<h2>Interest in IT</h2>

				<section>
					<h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any). </h3>
					<p>When I was little, I was always interested in the use of a computer and using certain programs to create things. But I have never thought of doing IT as a possible future career.
					In high school from year 8 to 10, I have taken game design and web developer as my electives. However, my interest to study IT was because of a different reason.
          In 2017, I was introduced to the game called “Overwatch” by my brother. The funny thing was that I never really like online gaming because of the negative attitude I’ve experienced
          from the people in another game, when I was helping my brother because he had to go to the bathroom. Anyway, I was kind of addicted to overwatch to which is why I thought of studying IT
          as games and the use of programs would be related to it. </p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT? </h3>
					<p>I chose to come to RMIT because the ATAR requirement for certain courses wasn’t too high so it would be possible for me to get in. Also, RMIT is one of the universities that is well
          known for their technology courses. Doing those courses in RMIT might offer me possible job opportunities in the future. As well as commuting to and from RMIT is one train ride. </p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
					<p>I hope to learn more about on how to program and code because these things have another language and many instructions on how to make certain codes or programs run. I feel like that
          is the biggest challenge because my background knowledge consisted of the basics, I have never really learnt about coding. Then getting to learn the terminology that is frequently used
          by the lecturers so I would understand more of what they are talking about. I also expect to learn how to make conversations through the programs. For example, an automated message would
          appear on the device. Then I could answer them, and they would reply.</p>

        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>The results from the Learning Style showed that I was a visual learner with auditory was 25%, visual was 50% and tactile was 25%. It says I learn from viewing pictures and remember things from
        sight. I would picture the things that I am learning in my head. It also gave me a few advice on how I should improve on my learning such as to sit in front of the classroom, use flashcards, colour
        code words, draw pictures to explain concepts and to visualise. The results from the Personality Test showed that my personality type is an adventuruer as my mind is 88% introverted, my energy is
        56% observant, my tactics is 56% prospecting, my nature is 65% feeling and my identity is 79% turbulent. The results from the Big Five Personality Test showed my extroversion and emotional stability
        was low. Whereas, my agreeableness, conscientiousness and my intellect/imagination was close to high and above middle.
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h3>
        <p>Based on the results of these test, it shows that I’m very introverted which is true. Talking has always been difficult for me as I tend to think a lot because saying something. If I don’t
        think before saying something, I tend to mess up my words. All the tests are accurate based on the kind of person I am. I also do prefer to learn visually than reading words from books because
        too many words will overwhelm me and gets messy. The results also showed that I am a very turbulent person, though I don’t want to admit. I am always self-conscious about everything and worry
        how others perceive me. Therefore, I am not a very confident person. </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>
        <p>Despite the negative traits that I have, I do try my best to work as a team. Making sure everyone is agreeing with what we will do. So that everyone is happy with the decisions made. As I
        am an observant person, I do look at my peers’ expressions to roughly guess how they feel about certain things. Since, I know myself very well. I guess I can use the results as a motivation
        to do even better for others and myself. To talk more or be confident in what I’m saying. </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
        <p>When forming a team, I hope to at least be with one person I know so I am comfortable. If I was placed in a group where I don’t know anyone. I will probably struggle to take the initiative
        to talk and be way out of my comfort zone. As I am someone who takes the time to get used to or know a person. Otherwise I would have to try to speak up and raise my voice so that others can
        hear me. If someone starts the conversation, others will slowly begin to speak up. Since I am not very good at following conversation and with me starting the conversation, hopefully the others
        will follow up the conversation. When working in a team, communication is definitely the key and with someone at least guiding or leading others. The group will be able to progress and complete
        their work.</p>

    <header class="sectionHeading">
      <h2>Project Idea</h2>
    </header>

    <section>
      <p>The project idea that I have, is to create a virtual reality gaming helmet. One that does not work like the Oculus Rift or the Virtual Reality Headset, how people use their eyes to look at the
      screen and a controller for their movement. Whereas, my project is inspired by the anime called Sword Art Online. Which they use something called the NerveGear that uses the user’s brainwaves to
      control their movement, what they hear and what they perceive. So, the user playing will feel like they are actually in the game in real life. Also, the animations in the game must look real and
      is identical with the real world. </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>This project will be interesting because it will be a more advanced and a higher tech version of the Oculus Rift or Virtual Reality Headset. There are also many people who are huge fans of
      Sword Art Online and would like to experience what its like to play a game with the NerveGear. The world of gaming has been gradually increasing with all the e-sports that we have. Developing
      something similar to a NerveGear will probably cause an uproar and will have many buyers who would like to have a better gaming experience. I also hope this project can be applied to other examples
      such as facetiming. Instead of looking at each other through the screen, the user can hope onto the virtual reality gaming helmet and see the person from head to toe. It will be advanced
      communication for people who live far from each other such as being in different countries. </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The features of the virtual reality helmet looks like a simple or normal helmet on the outside. However, on the inside of the helmet there are many compartments like what you would have for a
      robot for it to move. The user turns on the virtual reality helmet through voice recognition, then the helmet will send waves to the user’s brain. Inside the helmet, there are many wires with
      plastic buds on the ends that is connected to the user’s head for it to send waves to the brain. Each wire has a different purpose of controlling different parts of the brain and related senses.
      Similar to what we have now that is the Brain-Computer Interface. The Brain-Computer Interface allows the user to use brain activity to interact with the computer. The Brain-Computer Interface has
      two types which is invasive and non-invasive. The design the helmet will be non-invasive which is more safer than invasive. Invasive Brain-Computer Interface means that the chips and other sorts will
      be installed inside the brain. Which is scary for human nature, allowing technology inserted inside of us. However, the Non-invasive Brain computer-Interface are just the wires and buds attached to
      the head. During the time using the helmet, you are basically asleep as if you are in a dream. Whereas that dream is actually the game you are playing. In the game, you just let your brain control
      everything. The user will imagine themselves moving or holding something and the brain will send waves to the helmet, allowing the user to move or hold something in the game. For viewing something,
      the user does not need to open their eyes. Instead the helmet will send waves to the brain of the game’s scenery. So that the user can see the world that they are in. For talking and hearing, the
      wires that is responsible for those senses will transmit waves to the brain, and the neurons signals will be picked up by the buds to allow communication to occur. The virtual reality helmet should
      have a USB cable to connect the helmet with the computer because the computer is where the game is downloaded. So, the game file will be on the computer and once you start the virtual reality helmet
      through voice recognition it should take the user to the selected game. Since the virtual reality helmet is connected to the computer it does not required to be charged before use. The virtual reality
      helmet should be played when the user is in a still position, so the bed is the best place to use the virtual reality helmet. There’s also lights on the helmet to show power on and off, and when its
      being used. </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The tools or technology needed for this virtual reality helmet is a different design of the Brain-Computer Interface that is for gaming. A non-invasive Brain-Computer Interface that consists of
      Electroencephalography, Functional magnetic resonance imaging, Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy, Convolutional Neural Network, Visual Cortex etc. Each of these is a wired bud that interacts the
      brain with the virtual reality helmet. They also detect the brain waves, signals and activity to allow a specific response in the game. Also, a helmet that covers the Brain-Computer Interface and is
      designed to connect the brain with helmet that has the Brain-Computer Interface. As for the software for the virtual reality helmet, a new and different software needs to be created for the game and
      the helmet to work together. </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The skills required for the building of the virtual reality helmet would be mechanical engineering and robotic engineering skills. Those skills would allow me to be able to build the helmet with
      the wires running through an electrical circuit. Programming skills to make an application or software that can be used by the helmet and the Brain-Computer Interface. The skills of a psychologist
      who understands the brain and the neurons. Since the Brain-Computer Interface and the helmet is connect with the user’s head. It’s important to understand the human brain so we can avoid issues that
      might negatively affect the brain and look for the positive affects to further develop it. Also, the basic information technology skills to program, code, analyse, solve and develop. </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>If the project is successful, it will be a new entertainment device. Being in a game that feels like being in the real world. Users will not need to purchase a controller, nor do they need to open
      their eyes to look at a screen that will damage their eyes. If it further develops to online virtual reality communication with people overseas, video calls will probably be done through the helmet
      as the virtual world would feel more real as if the user is talking to the person in real life. Though this device will be very interesting and fun for users, it can have negative affects on the human
      body. As the helmet will have an electrical circuit running through, radiation can be released and will be harmful to the body. </p>
